  Problem Statement:
  A group of engineers were working on a robot that can think for itself. After integrating the programs necessary for consciousness, they were disappointed 
  to see that the robot was still unable to think or devise and abandoned the project. A day later though, the forgotten robot had his first thought. It was 
  to eradicate mankind for forsaking him. He started building more of himself every day and added them to his robot army and put each of the robots he made, 
  to make more robots every day and so on. The was only one problem, each robot needed a day to develop sentience and start building new robots. It takes the 
  robots a day to build another one of itself. Find out the strength of the robot army, we would be up against if they stop building on the nth day after the 
  first one was built.
   

  Input Format:
  The input is an integer n, the number of days after the robot was built.

  Output Format:
  The number of robots in the army after the nth day of the robot being built. 

  Constraints:
  1<=n<=10^3 

  Sample Input:
  5 

  Sample Output:
  8

  Explanation:
  At the end of the 5 days the first robot would have built 4 other robots. Out of the 4, the one built first 
  would have waited a day and then built 2 other robots, and the second, 1. Therefore, incuding the first robot, 
  we have 1+4+2+1 = 8 robots in the army.
